/*
	Server sided HP/Armour for 0.3d
	Created by Scott - scottreed36@gmail.com
	DO NOT DISTRIBUTE, LET'S KEEP UPPER HAND ON HACKERS BY KEEPING THIS METHOD SECRET
	
	Works because in 0.3d you can set everyone on server to same team, and they won't receive normal damage client side
	However, OnPlayerDamage is still called, so can use SetHP to create server sided armour/HP
	Another perk: Car parking and heliblading is now impossible, they just get stuck under car!
