[2018/1/3 - 20:37:02] ** General Admin Nicole Trey: haha cops arent gonna be happy
[2018/1/3 - 20:37:11] ** Executive Admin Jackson Dread: in the sense that you can kos them as well
[2018/1/3 - 20:37:13] ** General Admin Kobe Duron: because they have shotguns and sdpistols, factions got full wep sets
[2018/1/3 - 20:37:14] ** Advisor Richard Wingfield: @Tobi Admins changing the rules for them, Just play :)
[2018/1/3 - 20:37:15] ** Executive Admin Jackson Dread: it is fair
[2018/1/3 - 20:37:28] ** Advisor Tobi Saito: But he just said we can't
[2018/1/3 - 20:37:30] ** Executive Admin Jackson Dread: if they can kos cops you can kos them..
[2018/1/3 - 20:37:36] ** Advisor Tobi Saito: we need to tell them to leave first
[2018/1/3 - 20:37:39] ** General Admin Kobe Duron: its in the policy
[2018/1/3 - 20:39:00] ** Executive Admin Jackson Dread: you don't need to tell them to leave, if they shoot at any of you you're allowed to return fire.
[2018/1/3 - 20:39:02] ** Executive Admin Jackson Dread: fire.
[2018/1/3 - 20:39:14] ** Advisor Miyu Vikouri: You should keep an eye on Derek Lancer.
[2018/1/3 - 20:39:23] ** Advisor Tobi Saito: Jackson, explain to me how Gangs can KOS us but we can't KOS them is fair?
[2018/1/3 - 20:39:45] ** Executive Admin Jackson Dread: I don't know why it's worded that way i'll ask Jameson when he's on
[2018/1/3 - 20:40:01] ** Advisor Tobi Saito: dude this is not fucking Horizon
[2018/1/3 - 20:40:15] ** General Admin Kobe Duron: because cops main motive isn't to cause death, it's to keep order, Donnie
[2018/1/3 - 20:40:23] ** General Admin Kobe Duron: gangs' dont follow law
[2018/1/3 - 20:40:33] ** General Admin Kobe Duron: in the sense that if you did KOS then it would be non rp
[2018/1/3 - 20:40:40] ** Advisor Tobi Saito: That still doesn't make it OK for them to KOS us
[2018/1/3 - 20:40:50] ** Executive Admin Jackson Dread: ahh, that makes sense Kobe.
[2018/1/3 - 20:40:53] ** General Admin Kobe Duron: speak to kevin and spencer then
[2018/1/3 - 20:41:02] ** Advisor Miyu Vikouri: So you are telling me, gangs' motive is to cause death?>
[2018/1/3 - 20:41:09] ** Advisor Tobi Saito: If you want us to PREVENT death. Make turf timers stop when COPS are on the turf.
[2018/1/3 - 20:41:14] ** General Admin Kobe Duron: unless you roleplay otherwise
[2018/1/3 - 20:41:18] ** Advisor Miyu Vikouri: It sounds pretty stupid, I'd not accept a gang that has the motive of causing death alone.
[2018/1/3 - 20:41:23] ** Advisor Tobi Saito: That way it will never go down until they have left
[2018/1/3 - 20:41:34] ** General Admin Kobe Duron: you have darius's islamic state, what do you expect?
[2018/1/3 - 20:41:40] ** General Admin Kobe Duron: it's what you make of the roleplay scene
[2018/1/3 - 20:41:53] ** General Admin Kobe Duron: dont be getting your panties twisted 2 days after launch because it doesn't go your way
[2018/1/3 - 20:42:01] ** Advisor Tobi Saito: Letting them KOS us doesn't PREVENT us from killing them
[2018/1/3 - 20:42:04] ** General Admin Kobe Duron: if you can't see it from an unbiased point of view
[2018/1/3 - 20:42:19] ** Advisor Tobi Saito: it just makes us want to kill them even more.
[2018/1/3 - 20:42:33] ** Advisor Tobi Saito: Dude this ain't fair lol
[2018/1/3 - 20:42:44] ** Executive Admin Jackson Dread: it does make sense though
[2018/1/3 - 20:42:54] ** General Admin Kobe Duron: The only reason LEO's can't KOS at turf is because you have to follow your force matrix
[2018/1/3 - 20:42:54] ** Advisor Tobi Saito: We litreally just got fire squaded at turf
[2018/1/3 - 20:43:02] ** Advisor Tobi Saito: no chance to even fight back
[2018/1/3 - 20:43:07] ** General Admin Kobe Duron: The only reason LEO's can't KOS at turf is because you have to follow your force matrix
[2018/1/3 - 20:43:18] ** Senior Admin Kevin Kush: Gangs are allowed to KOS Gangs, Cops aren't they have to follow Force Matrix
[2018/1/3 - 20:43:26] ** Advisor Miyu Vikouri: In the force matrix it says we shoot when they are showing lethal force.
[2018/1/3 - 20:43:30] ** Senior Admin Kevin Kush: if they shooting then by all means shoot em
[2018/1/3 - 20:43:30] ** Advisor Tobi Saito: That should be an IC thing for the department to deal with
[2018/1/3 - 20:43:40] ** Senior Admin Kevin Kush: but if they standing still on turf and no on fighting
